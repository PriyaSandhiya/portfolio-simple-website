# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project consists of two pages: the home page and the contact page. The website is built using HTML for structure and basic CSS for styling.

## Pages

- **Home:** The home page serves as an introduction to who I am, my background, skills, and projects. Visitors can learn more about my work and interests.
- **Contact:** The contact page provides visitors with a way to reach out to me. It includes a contact form where they can submit inquiries or messages directly.
